Eating during pregnancy is extremely stressful because pregnant moms are picky about what they can or canâ€™t eat. Their dietary restrictions have different nutrient requirements from their pre-pregnancy days. Even nutrition labels on food are made for daily recommendations, but not for pregnant women. Our app will help solve this problem by logging food intake, taking into account food restrictions and preferences, and looking out for healthy food options when eating out.
