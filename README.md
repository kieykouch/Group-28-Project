## Project Description
Eating during pregnancy is extremely stressful because pregnant moms are picky about 
what they can or canâ€™t eat. Their dietary restrictions have different nutrient requirements
from their pre-pregnancy days. Even nutrition labels on nutritionFacts are made for
daily recommendations, but not for pregnant women. Our app will help solve this problem
by logging nutritionFacts intake, taking into account nutritionFacts restrictions and
preferences.
