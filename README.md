Eating during pregnancy is extremely stressful because pregnant moms are picky about what they can or canâ€™t eat. Their dietary restrictions have different nutrient requirements from their pre-pregnancy days. Even nutrition labels on nutritionFacts are made for daily recommendations, but not for pregnant women. Our app will help solve this problem by logging nutritionFacts intake, taking into account nutritionFacts restrictions and preferences, and looking out for healthy nutritionFacts options when eating out.
